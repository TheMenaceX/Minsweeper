# Minsweeper

Code for a minesweeper game. Use command Java Play "filename" in a terminal window to run the game. Filename must contain certain parameters for the game to run. 
An example config file has been provided. 

Future Features
- Will work on openCells method in Minfield so that more than just surrounding cells open like in the actual game.
- Will create a button that resets the game, instead of having to run the file from a terminal window.
